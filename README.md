GitHub Actions pushes each release from the source repository for this project as a commit. This enables the quick setup method above to work because most userscript managers will discover raw `.user.js` files and offer to import them.

GitHub Actions also publishes a release in this repository with the corresponding update notes. You can alternatively install by downloading from the Artifacts page for the [latest release](https://github.com/squishycat92/ExtendedFlorrUserscript/releases/latest/)

## Updates
New release versions of the userscript are generated automatically through GitHub Actions from the private source repository of this project. It is your responsibility to keep the client up-to-date, however, most userscript managers such as Tampermonkey will automatically check for updates and prompt you to install them.
