# Extended Florr
This repository hosts the client userscript of the ExtendedFlorr project.

## Installation
TBD after GitHub Actions is set up.

### Stable (Recommended)

### Bleeding Edge

## Updates
New versions of the userscript are generated automatically through GitHub Actions from the private source repository of this project. It is your responsibility to keep the client up-to-date, however, most userscript managers such as Tampermonkey will automatically check for updates and prompt you to install them.
