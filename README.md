# Extended Florr
This repository hosts the client userscript of the ExtendedFlorr project.

## Installation
### Quick Setup (Recommended)
[Install via Userscript Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squishycat92/ExtendedFlorrUserscript/refs/heads/main/client.user.js)

Click the link above and your userscript manager will offer to load the plugin for you. Then, all you have to do is refresh your game!

### Advanced Installation
Some userscript managers will not support automatic detection and installation of userscripts. In that case, you can download the `client.user.js` file from the install link above or from the [latest published release](https://github.com/squishycat92/ExtendedFlorrUserscript/releases/latest/).

## Updates
New release versions of the userscript are generated automatically through GitHub Actions from the private source repository of this project. It is your responsibility to keep the client up-to-date, however, most userscript managers such as Tampermonkey will automatically check for updates and prompt you to install them.
